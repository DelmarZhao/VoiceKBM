This is a list of valid commands for VoiceKBM and instructions for how to use them.

First, the pixel coordinate system used by the mouse commands has the upper-left corner as the origin - coordianates of (0,0).
The bottom-right corner of your screen has coordinates of the resolution of your screen, for example (1920, 1080) or (1600, 900).
Giving mouse commands with coordinate arguments greater than the resolution of your screen allows for will simply stop the movement command at the
maximum x or y coordinate based on your screen's resolution. No negative integers may be supplied as coordinates. 

In the following list of commands (#) indicates a non-negative integer to be supplied by the user, and (K#) represents the name of a keybaord key
to be supplied by the user, and [T] represents a list of words to be supplied by the user.
